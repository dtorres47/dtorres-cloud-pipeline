# dtorres-cloud-pipeline

This repository demonstrates a **cloud CI/CD pipeline** built with **GitHub Actions** to deploy projects to AWS.  
It highlights practical skills in **cloud automation, infrastructure pipelines, and cross-language development**.

## Purpose
The pipeline is used to deploy updated versions of **Spectra Stream**, an interactive streaming system currently implemented in **C#**.  
Over time, the system will be **migrated to Go**, showcasing adaptability across stacks while following a **vertical slice architecture** for clarity and scalability.

## Key Features
- Automated deployments with GitHub Actions  
- Cloud hosting on AWS (multi-cloud ready)  
- CI/CD pipeline for Spectra Stream and future projects  
- Emphasis on cross-language experience (C# → Go)  

## Future Enhancements
- Support for **multi-cloud deployments** (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Expanded CI/CD workflows with testing, linting, and monitoring  
- Migration of Spectra Stream core services from **C# to Go**  
- Additional portfolio projects integrated into the pipeline  

⚡ Work in progress as I expand my cloud automation and Go portfolio.
