					<p>Welcome! This site is a working example of a business landing page hosted entirely on the AWS cloud.

					your website can perform at an enterprise level—without enterprise-level costs.</p>
					<p>This temporary demo shows how we can take a sleek, custom layout and deploy it globally in minutes. 
					Everything you see is version-controlled through GitHub and auto-deployed using GitHub Actions.</p>
